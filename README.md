# LaTeX Resume Portfolio 📄

## Introduction 🚀
Welcome to my LaTeX Resume Portfolio repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing my professional resume, meticulously crafted using LaTeX—a versatile typesetting system known for its precision and flexibility. In this repository, you'll find not only my resume but also insights into the methods employed to create it and additional information about me.

## Resume Overview 📋
- **Resume Style**: My resume boasts a clean, professional style designed to make a strong impression in any professional context.

- **Efficiency**: LaTeX streamlines the resume creation process, ensuring consistency in formatting and making it a time-efficient solution for maintaining an up-to-date resume.

## LaTeX Code Highlights 🌟
- **Document Class**: The document is created using the `altacv` document class, specifically designed for CVs and resumes.
- **Fonts**: Depending on the LaTeX engine (pdflatex, xelatex, or lualatex), I've configured fonts to maintain a professional and visually appealing appearance.
- **Colors**: I've carefully selected colors, including Slate Grey, Pastel Red, and Golden Earth, to enhance the resume's visual appeal.
- **Sections**: The resume is organized into sections such as Objective, Projects, Certifications, Education, Skills, Libraries, Hackerrank, and Extra-Curricular, offering a comprehensive view of my profile.
- **Bullet Points**: LaTeX's bullet point customization is employed to present information clearly and effectively.

In addition to the resume, I've included a Projects section in the LaTeX code. This section describes various data analysis projects, each with its objectives, methods, and outcomes. It serves as a testament to my skills and experiences as a data analyst.

I've allocated sections to display my certifications and educational background, providing context for my qualifications.
